# Page View Time Series Visualizer

The time_series_visualizer.py file contains the main code that uses pandas to extract the data from fcc-forum-pageviews.csv and turn it into a dataframe. The script initially filter out the 2.5% of lowest and highest samples in terms of views and then creates a line plot detailing the overall views every day from May of 2016 until December of 2019 using matplotlib to generate the plot. 
The script also creates a bar chart of the average views per month from 2026 to 2019 by creating a copy of the filtered datframe and groups the data by year and average views per month to then create a pivot table in order to facilitate the process of creating the grouped bar chart using matplotlib. 
Finally, the script creates another copy of the dataframe to be used for the boxplot. The dataframe is sorted in such a way that the rows are in ascending order of month (from January to December) to make the boxplot look neater. By making use of Seaborn's PairGrid class, we make to different plots in one figure (one for yearly views and another for monthly views across all four years from 2016 to 2019).
The main.py file runs the time-series-visualizer and the test module automatically. The requirements.txt file contains the required package versions to be used for running the program optimally, and python version 3.8 is recommended for package compatibility.
